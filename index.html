    <H1> What is this? </H1>
    
    An Answer Set Programming system for generating overworld maps for use with the Solarus engine.
    
    <H1> Does it work? </H1>
    
    Yes, albeit not very fast - the system 
    
    <H1> How do I use it? </H1>
    
    First, set up the Quest Editor from the <a href = "http://www.solarus-games.org/">Solarus Project</a> (this system is tested on version 1.5.3).
    <br><br>
    Then, make sure that you have clingo 5 installed (<a href = "https://github.com/potassco/clingo/releases">from here</a>), and that it's able to run.
    Additionally, you need either Python 2 or 3 in order to run the script.
    <br><br>
    With that in place, download the contents of the repo from <a href = "https://github.com/jomazeika/ASPOverworldWFC">here</a>.
    Place the tool in the main quest folder for the Solarus Quest you which to generate maps for.
    <br><br>
    When all dependencies are installed, navigate to the folder in your favorite command line tool and issue the following commnad:
    <br>
    MapGen.py [MapCount] [Width] [Height] [paramFile] [outPutJSON]
    <br><br>
    Where the first 3 are integers, the paramFile is a customizable set of rules for controling the output.
    outPutJSON is any valid filename for a JSON file.
    <br><br>
    The maps will automatically be placed in the maps folder for your quest, ready to be included!
    
    <H1> What are you doing next? </H1>
    
    I want to refactor the system such that it solves faster; I have ideas about solving on a movement-only space before solving for the actual tiling itself.
    
    With any luck, I'll be able to expand this to include the full breadth of tiles, with a reasonable solving time.
