    <H1> What is this? </H1>
    
    An Answer Set Programming system for generating overworld maps for use with the Solarus engine.
    
    <H1> Does it work? </H1>
    
    Yes, albeit not very fast - the system 
    
    <H1> How do I use it? </H1>
    
    First, set up the Quest Editor from the <a href = "http://www.solarus-games.org/">Solarus Project</a> (this system is tested on version 1.5.3).
    With that in place, download the contents of the folder from <a href = "https://github.com/jomazeika/ASPOverworldWFC">here</a>. Then [Run the code].
    
    <H1> What are you doing next? </H1>
    
    I want to refactor the system such that it solves faster; I have ideas about solving on a movement-only space before solving for the actual tiling itself.
    
    With any luck, I'll be able to expand this to include the full breadth of tiles, with a reasonable solving time.
